## Features

### 1. Load songs from your phone
Users touch the gear icon on top-right to go to setting screen. Then choose scan music options to load song from your phone. They can also move to the photos main screen from here<br/>
- There is a toast will pop-up when load song operation is complete
- I used "Cursor" interface to query audio flie in MediaStore External Storage, then save them to local database

### 2. Search Functionality
Users touch the search icon next to gear icon on top-right to go to search screen. Quickly search for songs, albums, or artists by using the built-in search bar. Results are displayed in real-time as you type.<br/>

### 4. Auto-filter song
Auto-filter song by artist and album when the app starts<br/>

### 5. Music Playback
The app provides music playback with features such as play, pause, skip, shuffle, and repeat. The current track, album cover, and playback controls are shown on the now-playing screen.

### 6. Notification
Obviously, a music listening app cannot lack a notification. Users will use this notification to control the music player while the app is in the background.

### 7. Auto-change theme color
Now if you notice in the illustrations above, the color of the app is different, right? Yes, the app's theme color will automatically change gradually according to the current song's thumbnail. This also apply to notification's color. Enjoy your music in a visually pleasing environment.
- I used Pallete library to do this function
